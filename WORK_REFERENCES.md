### Excerpt

For a special Netflix event, 8020 Films produced the London segment of an engaging live discussion from between Aziz Ansari and Chris Rock in New York, highlighting Master of None's latest season. Despite the tight turnaround and the complex remote setup, our team ensured a flawless, natural conversation, demonstrating our exceptional live production capabilities.

### Body

Client Name:
Netflix
Project Overview:
In a high-profile project for Netflix, 8020 Films facilitated a live conversation between comedians Aziz Ansari in London and Chris Rock in New York, spotlighting the latest season of Netflix's acclaimed series, "Master of None." This project underscored our ability to execute high-profile, remote productions and live streaming with precision and creativity, even on a stringent two-day deadline.
Business Challenge:
Netflix's agency tasked us with producing the London segment of the video, aiming to foster a natural and engaging dialogue between the two stars. The challenge was to ensure seamless integration with Chris Rock's participation from New York, maintaining high production values and audience engagement throughout the live event.

Value Delivered:
Operating from an iconic London hotel, we had to deploy a small crew of three to manage a dual camera angles "interrotron" setup with live audio mixing. The use of a drop kit — a tablet mounted on a teleprompter fed into a Zoom call — allowed Aziz Ansari to maintain eye contact with the camera, simulating a natural conversation with Chris Rock. This setup not only enhanced the authenticity of the interaction but also demonstrated our innovative approach to remote production challenges, delivering an intimate and engaging experience for viewers and setting a benchmark for live streamed celebrity discussions.

Interviews with the founders added a personal touch, highlighting their vision and the human element behind the brand. Post-production and effects were used judiciously to enhance visual appeal and reinforce key messages.
