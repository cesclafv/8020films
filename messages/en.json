          "question": "How long should a brand storytelling video be?",
          "answer": "Length depends on platform and purpose. Hero brand films are typically 2-5 minutes for maximum emotional impact. We also create shorter cuts (30 seconds to 2 minutes) for social media and advertising. Many clients commission a full brand film alongside a suite of shorter pieces for different channels."
